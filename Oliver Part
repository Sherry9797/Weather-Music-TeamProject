i finished 3 html pages. please free to add id or class to develop css content.
for index.js.  this part i covered weather aip content. probably, the weather icon need to be update, for now the icon is not good.
for gallery.js  this part i did a image gallery to automatically images and i aslo set up a timer as cotrol.
in my opion, i think we could develop some content to make this gallery page more avtive.
